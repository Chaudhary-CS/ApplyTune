# 📊 How ATS Scoring Works - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **Your Goal: 70+ Score for Interview Callbacks**

Most companies only review resumes that score **65-75+** in their ATS. Here's exactly how we calculate it and how to guarantee 70+!

---

## 📐 **ATS Score Formula (Weighted Average)**

Your final ATS score is calculated using **5 components** with different weights:

```
FINAL SCORE = (Keyword Match × 40%) + (Skills Alignment × 25%) + 
              (Experience × 20%) + (Format Quality × 10%) + 
              (Action Verbs × 5%)
```

### **Example Calculation (Your Previous Score: 38.8/100)**

```
Component              Score    Weight    Contribution
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Keyword Match          39.3  ×  40%  =   15.7 points
Skills Alignment        0.0  ×  25%  =    0.0 points ⚠️
Experience Relevance   48.0  ×  20%  =    9.6 points
Format Quality        100.0  ×  10%  =   10.0 points ✅
Action Verbs           70.0  ×   5%  =    3.5 points
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL SCORE                             38.8/100 (POOR)
```

## 🔍 **1. Keyword Match (40% of Total Score) - MOST IMPORTANT!**

### **How It's Calculated:**

1. **Extract keywords from job description:**
   - Required skills (Python, PyTorch, Kubernetes)
   - Technical tools (TPUs, Ansible, Redis)
   - Domain terms (ML, Concurrency programming)

2. **Count matches in your resume:**
   ```
   Matched Keywords   = 8 out of 21
   Match Rate         = 8 / 21 = 38%
   Keyword Score      = 38 × 100 = 38/100
   ```

3. **Weight by importance:**
   - Required keywords count **2x**
   - Technical skills count **1.5x**
   - Other keywords count **1x**

### **How to Maximize This (Get to 70+):**

✅ **Add 12-15 keywords to your resume:**
- Your previous: 8/21 matched → 38/100 score
- Target: 15-18/21 matched → 70-85/100 score

✅ **Where to add them:**
1. **Bullet points** (primary): Natural integration
2. **Skills section** (backup): Direct listing
3. **Project descriptions** (bonus): Context-rich

✅ **Applytune Strategy:**
- Processes 15-20 bullets (not just 10)
- Adds keywords to Technical Skills section if needed
- Uses AI to insert naturally (preserves formatting)

## 💼 **2. Skills Alignment (25% of Total Score) - YOUR CRITICAL ISSUE!**

### **How It's Calculated:**

1. **Extract skills from job description:**
   - Technical: Python, PyTorch, C++, Golang, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis
   - Soft: Problem-solving, Self-directed learning

2. **Extract skills from your resume:**
   - Parse **Technical Skills** section
   - Extract from bullet points

3. **Calculate match rate:**
   ```
   Technical Skills Match = (Matched Tech Skills / Total Tech Skills) × 60%
   Soft Skills Match      = (Matched Soft Skills / Total Soft Skills) × 40%
   Skills Alignment Score = Tech Match + Soft Match
   ```

### **Why You Got 0.0/100:**

❌ **The parser couldn't extract your skills properly!**

**FIXED NOW:**
- Properly parses `\section{Technical Skills}`
- Extracts from all skill categories (Languages, Stack, etc.)
- Matches against job requirements

✅ **After fix: Expected 50-70/100 (from 0.0)**

## 🏢 **3. Experience Relevance (20% of Total Score)**

### **How It's Calculated:**

1. **Job title similarity (40% of this score):**
   ```
   Job posting: "Software Engineer Intern"
   Your titles:  "Software Development Intern", "Software Engineer Intern"
   Match: YES → 70-100/100
   ```

2. **Years of experience (30% of this score):**
   - Entry-level job + 2-3 internships = 80-90/100

3. **Relevant keywords in descriptions (30% of this score):**
   - Count technical keywords in your Experience section
   - Your score: 48/100 (moderate)

✅ **Your score: 48/100 (Already decent!)**

---

## 📄 **4. Format Quality (10% of Total Score)**

### **How It's Calculated:**

ATS checks for:
- ✅ Standard sections (Education, Experience, Skills)
- ✅ Clean formatting (no tables, images, columns)
- ✅ Readable fonts (11-12pt, standard fonts)
- ✅ Proper structure (bullets, headings)

✅ **Your score: 100/100 (Perfect! LaTeX is ATS-friendly)**

---

## 💪 **5. Action Verbs (5% of Total Score)**

### **How It's Calculated:**

Counts strong action verbs in your resume:
- Built, Engineered, Developed, Architected, Deployed, Improved, Reduced

```
Action Verb Count = 14 verbs
Action Verb Score = (14 / 20 ideal) × 100 = 70/100
```

✅ **Your score: 70/100 (Good!)**
